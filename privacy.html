                    Legal basis of processing 
                    <br />
                    The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following
                    applies:
                    <br />
                    Users have given their consent for one or more
                    specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner
                    may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User
                    objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to
                    rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
                    This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                    Personal Data is subject to European data protection
                    law;provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                    agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                    obligations thereof;processing is necessary for compliance
                    with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                    subject;processing is related to a task that is carried out
                    in the public interest or in the exercise of official
                    authority vested in the Owner;processing is necessary for
                    the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
                    Owner or by a third party.
                    
                    <br />
                    In any case, the Owner will gladly
                    help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                    processing, and in particular whether the provision of
                    Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
                    a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

                    processing are located. Depending on the User's location,
                    data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
                    country other than their own. To find out more about the
                    place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can

                    legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
                    European Union or to any international organization governed
                    by public international law or set up by two or more
                    countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures
                    taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data. If any such
                    transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking
